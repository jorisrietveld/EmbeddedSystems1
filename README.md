# Embedded Systems 1
This repository holds the source code for my school assignments for the Embedded Systems 1 Module.
<br>This is my first attempt at programming the Atmega32 in plain C, I have used the Arduino platform before
but I am currently learning about the bare programming of the micro controllers and creating circuits.
